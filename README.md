# es6-features
Just dinking around with ES6 via specs to learn the new features!

## Installation
To install all dependencies, including Jasmine and ESLint:

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage
To run all tests (found in `/spec`):

```
$ npm test
```

NOTE: ESLint will be run before all unit tests to catch syntax errors.
